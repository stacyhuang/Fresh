There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  The easiest way to keep track of your food expiration date and manage your grocery shopping list.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Never toss or eat expired food again.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  We have all been there - you decide to make a healthy home cooked meal and realize the eggs and steak in your fridge have expired. You are faced with guilt for tossing the food away and you decide eating out again might be the easier way. Wouldn't it be nice if you can keep track of when your food expires and maintain a to-buy list for grocery shopping?

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  This product helps solve the problem of people wasting food because the food items have reached their expiration dates.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  This product helps you keep track of the expiration dates of your food items so they are consumed on time. When you are at the market, you are able to see items near their expiration date

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Never toss or eat expired food again!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Simply add each item purchased and its expiration date after grocery shopping. Fresh will show you how many days left before your item expires. You can also add items that are expiring soon to your to-buy list for your next grocery shopping. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Thanks for Fresh, I never forget to buy milk again! Simple app that helps me keep track of my food items."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
